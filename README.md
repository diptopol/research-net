##Introduction:

Research is a systematic and experimental approach to create new knowledge. Research plays an essential role in developing human knowledge and civilization. There have been many tremendous research woks in human history. There have been also many intellectual people who shaped today’s world through their research works. All of the research works has been conducted in academic institutions. Even in this present age people outside of academic institutions cannot play any role in this sector.
But this limitation should be changed. We have to open the door of research works among the people. And “rNet” is a reflection of that change. In “rNet” it is possible for people who are outside of the academic institutions to participate actively in any research work. “rNet” will help people to communicate and transfer knowledge with each other even though they may separated by country or continent.
##Scope:

The scope of the project is limited to those people who are interested in any kind of research works and can work co-operatively.
##User’s role:

User has two roles.

  1. Mentor
  2. Collaborator 

A user can have any role between these two in a research project. These two roles have their own responsibilities.

###Mentor’s Responsibilities:

  * A mentor can create a research project and can work with other collaborators who will work in this project under his lead.
  * A mentor has to set the milestones or goal of the research project.
  * A mentor has the privilege to accept the report for achieving the milestone of the research project.
  * He can give feedback correspond to the report of the collaborators. 

###Collaborator’s Responsibilities:

  * A collaborator has to follow the milestones that are set by the mentor.
  * He can create report which will be reviewed by the mentor.
  * There can be multiple collaborators in a research project. But there will be one mentor for each research project.
  * A research project will be completely open to the collaborators and mentor who are associated with the project only. 

##Use Cases of The System:

**1st Phase:**

  **1. Registration:** A user has to provide a username, password and few personal information like name,address, email-address, profession to register in the site. Every user will have a unique id.
  
  **2. Login:** A user has to provide his username and password to login the site.
  
  **3. Profile:** A user can watch his profile. In profile there will be personal information of the user which will be documented. There will be a section where user can see his past research projects. He can import his previous published journal papers in this website.
  
  **4. Current Works:** A user can follow his current research projects. He can see the status of these projects and can navigate to the respective project.
  
  **5. Research Project Creation:** A user can create a research project. He has to provide the title of the research and a research proposal. The research proposal must reflect the depth of knowledge for working in this field. He has to choose a role for the respective research project. But he must have at least three complete research project in this field to become a mentor. 

**2nd Phase:**

  **1. Research Feed:** A user can see the recent research projects. He can navigate to any research proposal and can join the team if the project has not started yet.
  
  **2. Work Board:** A collaborator can see the ‘work board’. He can submit his report corresponding to the milestone. He can also watch the previous reports which are selected for previous milestones.
  
  **3. Report:** A collaborator can watch the detail report. He can give feedback to the report of other collaborators. A mentor can also give feedback and declare the report complete for the respective milestone.
  
  **4. Milestone List:** A user can see the milestone list of the research project. Mentor can change the list according to progress of the project.
  
  **5. Milestone Creation:** Mentor can create complete milestone list at the beginning of the research project. He can also update the milestone list. 

**3rd Phase:**

  **1. Journal Paper:** The users can collaboratively create and update an research paper. Mentor will view the progress of the research paper and give guideline them to improve the paper.
  
  **2. Resources:** There will be facility to share documents and other resources among the members of the project. Any collaborate can upload any resource and they will be available for other collaborators.
  
  **3. Tags:** The research project can use tag to represent the field of the research project. It will help user to find research project to specific field.
